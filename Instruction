### **Use the 'insurance' dataset**

Look for the best models and hyperparameters to predict each individual's insurance costs based on their characteristics.
- Do EDA to explore the dataset first.
- Perform modeling using linear regression, knn regressor, and decision tree regressor.
- Choose the best 1 model from the cross validation results, then tune the model.
- Compare model results before and after tuning.
